AIME machine learning container management system. 

Easily install, run and manage docker containers for the most common deep learning frameworks. 

## Features

* Setup and run a specific version of Tensorflow, Pytorch or Mxnet with one simple command

* Run different versions of machine learning frameworks and required libraries in parallel

* manages required libraries (CUDA, CUDNN, CUBLAS, etc.) in containers, without compromising the host installation

* Clear separation of user code and framework installation, test your code with a different framework version in minutes

* multi session: open and run many shell session on a single container simultaneously

* multi user: separate container space for each user

* multi GPU: allocate GPUs per user, container or session 

* Runs with the same performance as bare metal installation
